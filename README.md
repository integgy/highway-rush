# highway-rush

Background

This is my first coding/JavaScript project. My vision for this project is to create a game called 'Highway Rush.' In this game, your objective is to navigate a busy highway, dodging cars to survive as long as possible. Your score increases as you successfully evade incoming cars. The key to survival is maintaining your car's fuel levels and avoiding oncoming traffic. If your car sustains too much damage or runs out of fuel, the game ends. The longer you survive, the traffic will become more challenging, and car patterns will become harder to navigate




## Functionality & MVPs

In "Highway Rush," users will be able to:

- Drive a Car: Users can control a car using keyboard keys (e.g., arrow keys) to move it left, right, up, or down.
- Dodge Incoming Traffic: The game will feature a continuous stream of cars that users must dodge to avoid collisions.
- Fuel Management: Players need to manage their car's fuel level, and running out of fuel will result in a game over.
- Scoring System: Users will earn points for successfully dodging cars, and the score will increase as they survive longer.
- Difficulty Progression: The game's difficulty will increase as time progresses, with more traffic and more complex car patterns.

## Other Aspects of the Project

In addition, this project will include:

- Instructions in README: A detailed README file will provide instructions on how to play the game, including controls and game rules.
- Game Over Screen: When the game ends, a game over screen will display the player's score and an option to restart the game.
- Audio Effects: The game will include audio effects, such as engine sounds, collision sounds, and background music.


## Implementation Timeline


### Friday Afternoon
- Work on canvas creation and testing.
- Experiment with shapes and their movement.
- Implement collision detection for shapes.
- Enable shapes to move continuously on the canvas.
- Implement spawning of additional shapes as needed.

### Weekend
- Design the highway layout using Tiled map editor.
- Select models for the player's car and incoming traffic.
- Consider potential game elements.
- Fit the highway layout onto the canvas.
- Determine the appropriate sizes for game models.

### Monday
- Set up classes and functions for the highway, player car, incoming traffic, and game elements.
- Establish the core game logic.

### Tuesday
- Implement interactions between game elements.
- Track the player's score.
- Include a mechanism for player damage caused by incoming cars.
- Implement collecting fuel and fuel consumption.

### Wednesday
- Create visual elements for the player to monitor their current fuel level and score in the browser.
- Design a start menu to inform users about gameplay, controls, and starting the game.

### Thursday
- Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure seamless gameplay.
- Play through the game to identify logic or element issues.
- Make necessary fixes and adjustments during testing.
