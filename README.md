# highway-rush

Backaround
This is my first coding/javascript project. My vision for this project is to create a game called "highway rush".
In this game you will be dodging cars on the highway. Trying to survive as long as possible. Your score will increase
as you succfully dodge incoming cars. The key for surviving is to keep your car fueled up and avoid on coming traffic.
Too much damage or running out of fuel will be the end of the game. The longer you survive, the incoming traffic will increase
and the parrtern of the cars will become harder to navgate through.




## Functionality & MVPs

In "Highway Rush," users will be able to:

- Drive a Car: Users can control a car using keyboard keys (e.g., arrow keys) to move it left, right, up, or down.
- Dodge Incoming Traffic: The game will feature a continuous stream of cars that users must dodge to avoid collisions.
- Fuel Management: Players need to manage their car's fuel level, and running out of fuel will result in a game over.
- Scoring System: Users will earn points for successfully dodging cars, and the score will increase as they survive longer.
- Difficulty Progression: The game's difficulty will increase as time progresses, with faster traffic and more complex car patterns.

## Other Aspects of the Project

In addition, this project will include:

- Instructions in README: A detailed README file will provide instructions on how to play the game, including controls and game rules.
- Game Over Screen: When the game ends, a game over screen will display the player's score and an option to restart the game.
- Audio Effects: The game will include audio effects, such as engine sounds, collision sounds, and background music.
